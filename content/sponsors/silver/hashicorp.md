HashiCorp technology simplifies the operations of global applications, infrastructure, and security so organizations can focus on building the world of tomorrow. HashiCorp manages eight open source tools (Vagrant, Packer, Terraform, Consul, Nomad, Vault, Otto, and Serf) that span the full application and infrastructure lifecycle from development to production. Enterprise versions of Terraform, Vault, Consul, and Nomad enhance the respective open source tools with enterprise features that promote collaboration and policy-enforcement. The HashiCorp suite allows organizations to use one workflow to secure (Vault), provision (Terraform), monitor (Consul), and adapt (Nomad) applications (VM-based and container-based) on any provider (public cloud, private cloud, bare metal). Thousands of organizations — including Stripe, Cisco, Conde Nast, Pinterest, and Capital One — use HashiCorp technology to empower their developers to build the applications that will shape our future.
