Netflix has been leading the way for digital content since 1997

Netflix is the worldâ€™s leading Internet television network with over 81 million members in over 190 countries enjoying more than 125 million hours of TV shows and movies per day, including original series, documentaries and feature films. Members can watch as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, on nearly any Internet-connected screen. Members can play, pause and resume watching, all without commercials or commitments.

Behind the magic on thousands of devices is a talented team that develops the cloud services and applications that power the user experience. With the culture of freedom and responsibility, engineers are able to choose what tools they use, how they build systems, and how they manage them after they are in production. Although currently used in only a few places, Go is increasingly becoming the right tool at Netflix to solve problems and build new systems.

We are growing fast and solving big challenges. Come [join us](https://jobs.netflix.com) as we change the way entertainment is consumed globally.
