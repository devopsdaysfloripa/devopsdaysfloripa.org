[NATS](www.nats.io) is a high performance, open source messaging system designed for microservices, cloud native and IoT applications. The NATS Server is written in Golang, and there are also dozens of client libraries available.
 
Just like Go, NATS is all about simplicity and performance, making it an ideal choice for building high availability distributed systems. The protocol is plain-text, lightweight (the Docker image is a mere 7MB) and capable of sending over 10 Million messages per second while maintaining near zero latency. This simplicity and performance has seen NATS emerge as a developer standard for containerized microservices - the [NATS Official Docker Image](https://hub.docker.com/_/nats/)  has been downloaded over 500,000 times to date.
 
NATS was created by Derek Collison (@derekcollison), Founder and CEO of [Apcera](https://www.apcera.com), and has since been downloaded hundreds of thousands of times by the open source community.
