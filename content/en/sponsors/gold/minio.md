Minio is an object storage server, designed to be minimal and scalable. It stores objects such as photos, videos, container/VM images, log files and archives. Minio liberates applications written in the cloud to freely move to any private or public cloud environment, by enabling them to easily build their own scalable cloud storage infrastructure. Minio is hardware agnostic and works on a variety of physical and virtual/container environments. Minio is light enough to be bundled along with the application stack, similar to NodeJS and Redis.

Minio is written in Go and licensed under Apache License v2.
