Datadog is Monitoring-as-a-Service for Dev & Ops teams who want to turn the massive amounts of data produced by their apps, tools, and services into actionable insight, with native support for Go apps.

At Datadog we use Go extensively to power our backend services. We prize the language for its pragmatism, the runtime for its quality and the community for its vibrancy.

Much like the previous years we are very happy to be present at GopherCon as a sponsor. See you in Denver.
